# **Sky Watchers**

Users will be able to look up information regarding sunrise/set and moonrise/set times based on user entered location and date. </br>
For fun, there will be a section containing solar noon, distance from the sun, distance from the moon, on the date and time selected.

#### App Description/Background

When the page opens it will be showing space data for the users individual IP address, for that day.

Users will be able to look up information regarding sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset times based on location and the date; As for the location, We will be searching by City/State at this time. User should only type in the city or state of their choice

For fun, there will be a section containing Solar noon, Distance from the sun, distance from the moon, on the date and time selected, so this should change each time

#### Future Enhancements

In the near-ish future, I would like to add search parameters for latitude/longitude, date of choice, multiple dates at the same time, search multiple locations and show the data for each one.
